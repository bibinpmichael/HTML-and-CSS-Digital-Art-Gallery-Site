## Project Structure
This project uses HTML for structuring the web page and CSS for styling. The main components include:
- A header section with a hero image and title.
- A main content area with several art pieces, each displayed with an image and a description.
- A footer that provides additional information about the site and its purpose.

Each file and section is well-commented to aid understanding and further development. This setup provides a solid foundation for learning HTML and CSS best practices while exploring creative web design.
